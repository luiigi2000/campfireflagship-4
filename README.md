Level 3:

Move your mouse around the screen to dodge the super evil hands which want to shoot lasers at u for no particular reason. What did u do to piss off a ton of hands? Seriously? Oh yeah, they can shoot each other too. Use that to your advantage.

Level 4:

Click around the screen and try to find all 10 hidden keys. Every so often, they will emit a radar to help you find your way. You spin me right round... man I'm dizzy.

Level 5:

Worm Grunting 101 crash course. First, you want to click and drag the t shaped stick to a position for which the radius displayed under the stick has a dot/worm in sight. Then you will move your mouse back and fourth to create vibrations that attract the worms towards the stick, freaky ah worms.  Then you AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. (you'll understand)

Level 6:

Your goal is to mow the entire lawn, simple enough? Just make sure not to hit those moles okay? To dodge those pesky moles, use a/d or left/right to change the direction of the lawn mower. Clear skies might not last long so make sure to click/punch the cloud when it starts to look storm; it makes the clown happy for some reason, weird... Don't do it early though, no one likes to get hit when they are happy, don't be mean. >:(.
